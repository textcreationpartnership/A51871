            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Preface: Shewing the Scope and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of this Booke.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Purpoſe is not to inſtruct thoſe, whoſe Experience and Obſervation, have made them as ſufficient (or more) then my ſelfe: yet even they ſhould loſe nothing by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring: (for I have profited by mine owne labour, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this;) But my intent, and the uſe of this Book, is, to inſtruct one, whoſe Qualitie, Attendance, Indiſpoſition of bodie (or the like) cannot permit to gain the knowledge of Termes, Names, Words, the Parts, Qualities and manner or doing things with Ships, by long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: without which there hath not any one arrived (as yet) to the leaſt judgement or knowledge of them: It being ſo, that very few Gentlemen (though they be called Sea-men) doe fully and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what belongs to their Profeſſion; having only ſo me ſcrabling Termes and Names belonging to ſome parts of a Ship. But he who will teach another muſt underſtand things plainly, and diſtinctly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, (that in ſtead of reſolving another mans doubts, he doe not puzell him with more confuſion of Termes of Art) and ſo (to appeare to know ſomewhat) will ſtill expound <hi>Ignotum per ignotius.</hi> And for profeſſed Sea-men, they either want abilitie, and dexteritie to expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or (as they all doe generally) will, to inſtruct any Gentleman: If any will tell me why the vulgar ſort of Sea-men hate land-men ſo much, either he or I may give the reaſon, why they are ſo unwilling to inſtruct them in their Art: whence it is that ſo many Gentlemen goe long Voyages, and returne (in a manner) as ignorant, and as unable to doe their Countrey Service, as when they went out. Theſe Words, Termes, and Proper Names, which I ſet down in this Book, are belonging ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Ship, to ſhew her parts, qualities, or ſome things neceſſary to the managing and ſailing of her; or to the Art of Gunnerie (for ſo much<pb facs="tcp:51209:3"/>as concernes the uſe of Ordnance at Sea,) and thoſe which are familiar words, I ſet them downe; if they have any uſe, or meaning about a Ship, other then the common ſence: And in expounding them, I doe ſhew what Uſe, Neceſſitie, Commoditie, diſcommoditie, wherefore, and how things are done, which they import: And therewith the Proper Termes, and Phraſes, with the different uſes, in any kind appertaining to that word; which for better and eaſier finding-out, and to avoid confuſion, I have brought into an Alphabet.</p>
            <p>The Uſe and Benefit whereof is ſo apparent for any who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Sea, or for any who may be called to cenſure and judge of Sea-affaires, that I need uſe two reaſons, to enforce it: Only thus much: This booke ſhall make a man underſtand what other men ſay, and ſpeake properly himſelfe; which how convenient, comely, and neceſſary a thing it is, all men (of ſence) doe know. Should not man be Leaſhed (being a hunting or hawking) if he ſhould cry <hi>Hey,-Ret,</hi> to the Hownds, and <hi>hooke againe</hi> to the Spaniels: Or were it not ridiculous for a man (ſpeaking of the wars) to call a trench a Ditch: Or (at Sea) the Star-boord, and Lar-boord, the right and the left-ſide of a Ship, and yet they doe ſimply the ſame, and both dogs and men will underſtand them alike.</p>
            <p>To underſtand the Art of Navigation is far eaſier learned then to know the Practique of Mechanicall working of Ships, with the Proper, Termes belonging to them: In reſpect that there are helps for the firſt by many books (which give eaſie and ordinary Rules for the obtaining to it,) but for the other, till this, there was not ſo much as a meanes thought of, to informe any one in it: if a man be a ſufficient Sea-man with whom I converſe, and yet know not how to inſtruct me, I grant he may be fit to ſave his Countrey, but not his friend: But I will ſpeake it with as much confidence as truth, that in ſix monethes, he, who would but let me read this booke over with him, and be content to look ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a Modell of a Ship, &amp; ſee things how they are done, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great ſtudie, but converſation, know more, be a better Sea-man, and ſpeake more properly to any buſineſſe of the Sea, then any other Gentleman, who ſhall go (two or three yeares together) to Sea, without this: for by the peruſing of this Booke, he ſhall not only know what to queſtion, or doubt of, but likewiſe be reſolved.</p>

               <head>Anchor.</head>
               <p>The forme and generall uſe of an <hi>Anchor</hi> is commonly knowne: but the ſeverall parts, proportions, diſtinctions and appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, underſtood by very few, but practiſed and experienced Sea-men: The <hi>Anchor</hi> doth conſiſt of theſe ſeverall parts: The Ring, the Eye, the Head, the Nutt, the Beame or Arme, the Shanck, the Flooke, to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs a ſtocke by which it is made to take hold.</p>
               <p>The proportion which it holds in it ſelfe is, The ſhancke is thrice as long as one of the flookes, and halfe the beame. The proportion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Shipping is, To a Ship of 500 tun, we allow 2000 weight for a ſheate <hi>Anchor,</hi> The higgeſt Ship in <hi>Englands</hi> Anchor, is but 3500;<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51209:6"/>The diſtinctions are made by their uſe, according to the proportion they beare in the Ship in which they are imployed; for that, which in one Ship would be called but a <hi>Kedger, <hi>or</hi> Kedge Anchor,</hi> in a leſſer, would be a ſheate <hi>Anchor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſorts of <hi>Anchors,</hi> which by occaſion of their ſeverall uſes receive different names and appellations, are firſt a
<hi>Kedge,</hi> which is the ſmalleſt, which by reaſon of their lightneſſe, is firſt to ſtoppe the Ship in kedging downe a River. The next a Streame <hi>Anchor,</hi> which we uſe in deep waters to ſtop a tide withall in faire weather. The other they call by the name of the firſt, ſecond or third <hi>Anchor,</hi> (all theſe being ſuch as the ſhip may ride by in any reaſonable weather, Sea-gate or tyde. Theſe are ſomething bigget one then an other: And uſually when they ſayle in any ſtraights or are neere a Port, they carry two of theſe at the Bowe. In which reſpect, they are alſo called by the name of the firſt, ſecond or third Bowes.) The other which is the biggeſt, and that which the Sea-men call their laſt-hope, and is never uſed but in great extremity, is called the
<hi>Sheate Anchor,</hi> this is the true <hi>Anchora Spei,</hi> for this is their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. The <hi>Anchor</hi> is a Peeke, that is, when heaving up the <hi>Anchor,</hi> the Cabell is right perpendicular betwixt the Hawes and the <hi>Anchor.</hi> The <hi>Anchor</hi> is a Cock-bell, which is, when the
<hi>Anchor</hi> hangs right up and downe by the Ships ſide: and this appointed by the Maſters, when they are ready to bring the Ship to an:
<hi>Anchor.</hi> Let fall the <hi>Anchor,</hi> that is, let in goe downe into the Sea. The <hi>Anchor</hi> is fowle, that is, when the Cabell by the turning of the Ship is got about the flooke, which will not only cut the Cabell a-ſunder, but make the <hi>Anchor</hi> not in hold: And therefore when ever we come to an <hi>Anchor,</hi> where there is tyde, we lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out two
<hi>Anchors,</hi> ſo as that, upon the turning of the tyde, the Ship wind up eleere of either <hi>Anchor,</hi> cleere the <hi>Anchor,</hi> that is, get the Cabell off the flooke; or generally, when they let fall the <hi>Anchor,</hi> they uſe this terme, to ſee that the Buoy-Rope, nor in other ropes do hang about it, fetch or bring home the <hi>Anchor,</hi> that is, to weigh it in the Boate, and bring it a-boord the Ship. The <hi>Anchor</hi> comes home, that is, when the Ship drives away with the tyde or ſea; This may happen, either becauſe the <hi>Anchor</hi> is too ſmall for the burthen of the ſhip, or for that the ground may be ſoft and one, In ſuch places, we uſe to ſhoe the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> that is, to put boords to the ſtooke in the forme of the ſtooke, and make it much broader then before: In <hi>Porto Fareen</hi> by

<hi>Anchor,</hi> where the ground being ſo ſoft, we ſhod our
<hi>Anchors</hi> and yet they all came home, and the Ships drave a-ground, only, one ſhip, which had an <hi>Anchor</hi> tallowed, too faſt, the reaſon I could never truly know, but ſuppoſe that it might be, becauſe that the tallow ſunck deeper into oze, and finds ſome harder ground at the bottome, then the other.

               <p>Is when we let fall an <hi>Anchor,</hi> or more, into the Sea, with Cabells to them, ſo that the Ship may ride-faſt by them; we ſay, there is good Anchoring, where there is ſhowle water, for in deep waters, the Sea hath more force againſt the Ship, and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors</hi> are very long a waying upon any occaſion: Ground that is not too ſoft or ozie, in which the <hi>Anchors</hi> can have no faſt hold: nor too hard or knotty, ſo that it may cut the Cabells: The beſt ground to ride in, is a ſtiffe clay, or hard ſand: Alſo, where they may ride out of the way of the tyde: And laſtly, where they may ride Land-locked, ſo as that the ſea-gate, can have no power againſt them: To which may be added, that the Lee-ſhore on every ſide is ſo ſoft, that if a ſhip come a-ground, ſhe can catch no hurt, or elſe that they may have ſea-roome to ſet ſaile, if their Cabells breake, or their <hi>Anchors</hi> come home. That place which hath all theſe commodities, is good to ride in, and here we ſay is good Anchoring, or good Anchorage; bad Anchoring, or bad Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, is in a place where all or many of the contrary conditions are to be found.</p>

A long-boord is, when you ſtand a great way off before you tack or turne. A ſhort-boord, is when you ſtand-off but a little. A good boord, is when we have got up much to wind-ward, for ſometimes we take a great deale of paines, and get little, either by reaſon of a current or tyde, that may take her on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bowe, or by reaſon of a head-ſea, which may drive her to Lee-ward, and hinder her way, or for that the ſhip may be a Lee-ward ſhip: Sometimes againe, when it is a ſmooth ſea; a current under the Lee-bowe, and a good ſhip by a wind, ſhe will get a point or two more in the wind then we expect.

In fight, to boord a ſhip, is to bring the ſhip to touch the other, where you muſt note the advantages and diſadvantages of every place in boording: and know that when two ſhips ſight, the defendant may chooſe whether you ſhall boord him or no, but only in the quarter, which is a bad place to boord: For men can worſt enter there, in reſpect that it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the ſhips hull: and for that there is only the Miſſen-ſhrowdes to enter by; as alſo, for that ſhips are hotteſt there, and men being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred there can doe little good, and are eaſily skowred off with Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers from the cloſe-ſights: the beſt boording for entring; is if you can, to boord on the bowe, for then you may quickly bring all your broade-ſide to: but the greateſt advantage for uſe of Ordnance, is to boord a-thwart her hawes, for then you may uſe all your Ordnance on one ſide, and ſhe can only uſe her Chaſe and her Prowe Peeces.</p>

This careening is to be done in harbour, where the ſlower the tide runs the better: And it is moſt commonly uſed in ſuch places, where there are no decks to trim a ſhip in, nor no good places to grave a ſhip on, or elſe that it doth not ebbe ſo much that a ſhip may ſhew-drie; For the manner of careening, it will be too long and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51209:15"/>to ſet downe all the particulars: In generall, it is thus, they take out all, or leave but little of the proviſion, Ballaſt, Ordnance (or the like) in the ſhip: and you muſt have a lower ſhip by her, with which ſhe muſt be haled-downe on a ſide, and righted againe with tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles (yet with the weight of ballaſt above, or below, they doe effect the chiefe force of the buſineſſe, and ſo never ſtraine the ſhips maſts much:) Note that all ſhips are not of a like condition to careene; for ſome ſhips will be very hard to come downe, though they have no bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt in them, and thoſe are flemmings, built with two ſtanding ſtreakes, theſe muſt have ſome weight upon the deck to help them downe, and yet theſe will right themſelves very eaſie, and therefore need not much in holde to help to right them; Some, as our Engliſh built, and the like, will come downe eaſie, and be hard to right, and therefore we keep ſomewhat in all theſe (to right them) in holde, and having nothing on the deck, ſome will come-downe eaſie and right themſelves well: Some will doe neither, ſo that there is not one way for all, but as we ſee the condition of the ſhip, we fit things, and worke accordingly, any kind of bringing the Ship over to lye on-one-ſide (ſhe being on floate) is called careening, though it be but a few ſtreakes; as we ſay, ſhe was careened three, foure or five ſtrakes: If a ſhip lie downe much with a ſaile, they will ſay, ſhe ſailes on the careene.</p>

               <p>I think this word comes of <hi>conducere</hi> in Latine; ſo it imports as much as to leade or direct the ſhip which way ſhe ſhall goe; it is commonly pronounced thus: Cun the ſhip, which implies as much as to direct him at helme how to ſteere. In long courſes, when we are off at ſea, there is not ſo much heed taken of it, for then they direct their courſe upon a point of the Compaſſe, and ſo let him at the helm look to the ſteere right on that point; but in chaſes and narrow channels (where the courſe lyes not directly upon a point of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe) there the Maſter, Mate, or ſome other ſtanding-aloft, doth give direction to him at the helme; and this we call conding or cuning: Sometimes hee who commands the ſhip will be ſpeaking to him at helme, at every little yawe, (which the ſea-faring love not, as being a kind of diſgrace to their Iteeridge) then in mockage they will ſay, ſure the channell is narrow he conds ſo thick; whereby you may gather, that in narrow channels, it is neceſſary and uſefull to cond thick. Note that according as the ſhips ſailes are trimmed either before or by a wind, ſo they uſe ſeverall termes in conding, and to uſe other, were improper and ridiculous amongſt them: If the ſhip goe before a wind, or as they terme it, betwixt two ſheates, then he who conds uſes theſe termes to him at the helme, ſtarr-boord, lar-boord, the helme a mid-ſhips. Note that when we ſay ſtarr-board, the meaning is, that he muſt put the helme to the ſtarr-board ſide, and then the ſhip will goe to larr-boord, for the ſhip doth ever goe contrary to the helme, if the ſhip goe by a wind, or quarter-winds, they ſay a loofe, or keep your loof; or fall not off, veere no more, keep her to: touch the wind; have a care of the lee-latch; all theſe do imply the ſame in manner, and are to bid him at the helme, to keep her neere the wind: Eaſt the helme; no neere; beare up; theſe words do appoint him to keep her from the wind, and make her goe more large or right before: Some ſpeeches are common to both, as ſteddy, that is, keep the ſhip from going in and out, but juſt upon the point that you are to ſteere, and as you goe; and ſuch like.</p>

It will (be it placed as well as can be) hinder the uſe of the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. 2. It will lie over the powder. 3. Being a man of war pretends to fight moſt with his prowe; that part is likewiſe to receive ſhot, which if any chance to come amongſt the bricks in the Cooke-roome they will ſpoyle more men then the ſhot: And beſides, the Cook-roome it ſelf for that voyage is ſpoyled, there being no meanes to repaire it at ſea, and then they muſt needs uſe another; ſo that I thinke no man of diſcretion wil commend or uſe that for moſt ſufficient, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is moſt ſubject to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and cannot be repaired. 4. A man of war, ever carries much ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance there, and therefore it is fit to avoid (as much as may be, any weight that may charge her fore-ſhip.
5. It is dangerous for firing the ſhip: for being made-up to the ſhip-ſides, ſo that men cannot go round about it in long continuance, and much heating they may fire the ſhip unawares. 6. It takes away the grace and pleaſure of the moſt important and pleaſanteſt part of all the ſhip: for any one who comes a boord a man of warre, will principally look at her chaſe, being the place where the chiefe offenſive force of the ſhip ſhould lie. And to conclude, I do not know any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie it can give to a man of warre: wherefore in my opinion, the beſt placing the Cooke-roome, is in the hatch-way, upon the firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop (not in the howld, as the Kings ſhips doe, which muſt needs ſpoyl all the victuals with too much heating the howld, or at the leaſt, force them to ſtowe it ſo neare the ſtern and ſterne, that it muſt needs wrong and wring the ſhip much, and looſe much ſtowage: and it being there placed, as it doth avoid all the former inconveniences, both of the hold and fore-caſtle, and yet ſhall be as ſerviceable, ſo hath it this benefit more: That it doth wonderfully well aire the ſhip betwixt the decks, which is a great health unto the company. But if I were to goe to Sea,<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51209:20"/>as a man of warre, I would have no Cook roome at all; but ſuch an one as I would have contrived to be removed, and ſtrooken downe in howld if I liſt, and yet it ſhould waſte no more wood then theſe doe, and dreſſe ſufficient victuals for the companie, and roaſte or bake ſome competent quantitie for the Commander; or any perſons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>

               <p>We ſay a ſhip Rides, whenas her Anchors doe hold her faſt, ſo as that ſhe doth not drive away with the tide or wind: for though ſhe ſheere from one ſide to the other, yet if her Anchors doe hold faſt, and come not home, we ſay ſhe Rides: To Ride a good Roade, that is to Ride, where the ſea, and wind had much power over the ſhip, and ſtraine her Cabels very hard: Note a ſhip rides eaſieſt, and with more ſecuritie, having but two Cabels ſpliſed together (which they call a ſhot) then ſhe will by three ſingle Cabels, for the length of the ſhot will give her more ſcope, to play, and riſe upon the ſea with eaſe; for by reaſon alſo of the waight, the ſhip can hardly ſtraine it: For when a great ſea comes to yerk-up the ſhip, the ſhot is long before it comes to ſtraining, that the force of the ſea will be paſt before it can come up to beare ſo much ſtreſſe, as a ſhorter Cabell would doe: The deeper the water is, the worſer it is to Ride, and requires much more Cabell in proportion then ſhowler-water, the ſea will breake more, yet it hath not that power and waight which the deep water hath, when we Ride any extraordinary roade, we ſtrike downe our top-maſts, and bring our yards alongſt ſhips, in much wind eſpecially: To<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51209:47"/>ride a croſſe, is to ride with our maine-yards and fore-yards hoyſed up to the hounds, and both yard-armes topped a-like: To ride a Peeke, is to ride with the yards Peeked a-Peeke; and alſo when we ride with the Hawes juſt over the Anchor, then we ride a-Peeke, that is, when we ride ready to ſet ſaile; when they would expreſſe that they have rid a great Roade and ſtreſſe, they ſay they rid hawſe-fall, that is, that the water brake into the Hawſes: To ride thwart, is to ride with her ſide to the tide, then ſhe never ſtraines her Cabels: To Ride betwixt wind and tide, is when the wind and tyde have equall power, one, one way, the other, the other way, ſo that the ſhip lies rowleing with her broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the Trough of the ſea, and thus ſhe will rowle mightily, but not ſtraine her Cabels.</p>

3/7 of the Maine-yard: and the Maine-yard for bigneſſe, is to be ¾ of an Inch for a yard in length: the length of the fore-yard is to be ⅘ of the main-yard: The Croſſe-Jack-yard, and ſprit-ſaile-yard, is to be all of a length, but allow the Miſſen-yards, and ſprit-ſaile-yards ½ an Inch thickneſſe to a yard in length: Top the yards, (that is, make them hang even:) the Clew-lines doe properly top the Maine and fore-yards: but when the Top-ſailes are Stowed, then the Top-ſaile ſheates will top them: Braſe the yard (that is, Travers aft that yard-arme, whoſe braſe is haled) and by the braſes we ſquare the yards, that is, make them hang right-a-croſſe, and one yard arme not Traverſed more then the other: If the Shrowdes be ſet too forward, they will hinder the traverſing of the yard: Traverſing the yard, is to braſe aft the yard.</p>
